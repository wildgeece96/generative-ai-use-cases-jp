<Information>
Tasks are by default sequential. A task start date defaults to the end date of the preceding task.

A colon, :, separates the task title from its metadata. Metadata items are separated by a comma, ,. Valid tags are active, done, crit, and milestone. Tags are optional, but if used, they must be specified first. After processing the tags, the remaining metadata items are interpreted as follows:
1. If a single item is specified, it determines when the task ends. It can either be a specific date/time or a duration. If a duration is specified, it is added to the start date of the task to determine the end date of the task, taking into account any exclusions.
2. If two items are specified, the last item is interpreted as in the previous case. The first item can either specify an explicit start date/time (in the format specified by dateFormat) or reference another task using after <otherTaskID> [[otherTaskID2 [otherTaskID3]]...]. In the latter case, the start date of the task will be set according to the latest end date of any referenced task.
3. If three items are specified, the last two will be interpreted as in the previous case. The first item will denote the ID of the task, which can be referenced using the later <taskID> syntax.
Metadata syntax	Start date	End date	ID
<taskID>, <startDate>, <endDate>	startdate as interpreted using dateformat	endDate as interpreted using dateformat	taskID
<taskID>, <startDate>, <length>	startdate as interpreted using dateformat	Start date + length	taskID
<taskID>, after <otherTaskId>, <endDate>	End date of previously specified task otherTaskID	endDate as interpreted using dateformat	taskID
<taskID>, after <otherTaskId>, <length>	End date of previously specified task otherTaskID	Start date + length	taskID
<taskID>, <startDate>, until <otherTaskId>	startdate as interpreted using dateformat	Start date of previously specified task otherTaskID	taskID
<taskID>, after <otherTaskId>, until <otherTaskId>	End date of previously specified task otherTaskID	Start date of previously specified task otherTaskID	taskID
<startDate>, <endDate>	startdate as interpreted using dateformat	enddate as interpreted using dateformat	n/a
<startDate>, <length>	startdate as interpreted using dateformat	Start date + length	n/a
after <otherTaskID>, <endDate>	End date of previously specified task otherTaskID	enddate as interpreted using dateformat	n/a
after <otherTaskID>, <length>	End date of previously specified task otherTaskID	Start date + length	n/a
<startDate>, until <otherTaskId>	startdate as interpreted using dateformat	Start date of previously specified task otherTaskID	n/a
after <otherTaskId>, until <otherTaskId>	End date of previously specified task otherTaskID	Start date of previously specified task otherTaskID	n/a
<endDate>	End date of preceding task	enddate as interpreted using dateformat	n/a
<length>	End date of preceding task	Start date + length	n/a
until <otherTaskId>	End date of preceding task	Start date of previously specified task otherTaskID	n/a
For simplicity, the table does not show the use of multiple tasks listed with the after keyword. Here is an example of how to use it and how it's interpreted:
例:
gantt
    apple :a, 2017-07-20, 1w
    banana :crit, b, 2017-07-23, 1d
    cherry :active, c, after b a, 1d
    kiwi   :d, 2017-07-20, until b c

Title
The title is an optional string to be displayed at the top of the Gantt chart to describe the chart as a whole.

Excludes
The excludes is an optional attribute that accepts specific dates in YYYY-MM-DD format, days of the week ("sunday") or "weekends", but not the word "weekdays". These date will be marked on the graph, and be excluded from the duration calculation of tasks. Meaning that if there are excluded dates during a task interval, the number of 'skipped' days will be added to the end of the task to ensure the duration is as specified in the code.

Weekend
When excluding weekends, it is possible to configure the weekends to be either Friday and Saturday or Saturday and Sunday. By default weekends are Saturday and Sunday. To define the weekend start day, there is an optional attribute weekend that can be added in a new line followed by either friday or saturday.
例: 
gantt
    title A Gantt Diagram Excluding Fri - Sat weekends
    dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD
    excludes weekends
    weekend friday
    section Section
        A task          :a1, 2024-01-01, 30d
        Another task    :after a1, 20d

Section statements
You can divide the chart into various sections, for example to separate different parts of a project like development and documentation.

To do so, start a line with the section keyword and give it a name. (Note that unlike with the title for the entire chart, this name is required.

Milestones
You can add milestones to the diagrams. Milestones differ from tasks as they represent a single instant in time and are identified by the keyword milestone. Below is an example on how to use milestones. As you may notice, the exact location of the milestone is determined by the initial date for the milestone and the "duration" of the task this way: initial date+duration/2.
例: 
gantt
    dateFormat HH:mm
    axisFormat %H:%M
    Initial milestone : milestone, m1, 17:49, 2m
    Task A : 10m
    Task B : 5m
    Final milestone : milestone, m2, 18:08, 4m

Setting dates
dateFormat defines the format of the date input of your gantt elements. How these dates are represented in the rendered chart output are defined by axisFormat.

Input date format
The default input date format is YYYY-MM-DD. You can define your custom dateFormat.

markdown
dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD

The following formatting options are supported:

Input	Example	Description
YYYY	2014	4 digit year
YY	14	2 digit year
Q	1..4	Quarter of year. Sets month to first month in quarter.
M MM	1..12	Month number
MMM MMMM	January..Dec	Month name in locale set by dayjs.locale()
D DD	1..31	Day of month
Do	1st..31st	Day of month with ordinal
DDD DDDD	1..365	Day of year
X	1410715640.579	Unix timestamp
x	1410715640579	Unix ms timestamp
H HH	0..23	24 hour time
h hh	1..12	12 hour time used with a A.
a A	am pm	Post or ante meridiem
m mm	0..59	Minutes
s ss	0..59	Seconds
S	0..9	Tenths of a second
SS	0..99	Hundreds of a second
SSS	0..999	Thousandths of a second
Z ZZ	+12:00	Offset from UTC as +-HH:mm, +-HHmm, or Z

Output date format on the axis
The default output date format is YYYY-MM-DD. You can define your custom axisFormat, like 2020-Q1 for the first quarter of the year 2020.
例；
axisFormat %Y-%m-%d

The following formatting strings are supported:

Format	Definition
%a	abbreviated weekday name
%A	full weekday name
%b	abbreviated month name
%B	full month name
%c	date and time, as "%a %b %e %H:%M:%S %Y"
%d	zero-padded day of the month as a decimal number [01,31]
%e	space-padded day of the month as a decimal number [ 1,31]; equivalent to %_d
%H	hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number [00,23]
%I	hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number [01,12]
%j	day of the year as a decimal number [001,366]
%m	month as a decimal number [01,12]
%M	minute as a decimal number [00,59]
%L	milliseconds as a decimal number [000, 999]
%p	either AM or PM
%S	second as a decimal number [00,61]
%U	week number of the year (Sunday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number [00,53]
%w	weekday as a decimal number [0(Sunday),6]
%W	week number of the year (Monday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number [00,53]
%x	date, as "%m/%d/%Y"
%X	time, as "%H:%M:%S"
%y	year without century as a decimal number [00,99]
%Y	year with century as a decimal number
%Z	time zone offset, such as "-0700"
%%	a literal "%" character

Axis ticks
The default output ticks are auto. You can custom your tickInterval, like 1day or 1week.
例: 
tickInterval 1day
The pattern is:
/^([1-9][0-9]*)(millisecond|second|minute|hour|day|week|month)$/;
Week-based tickIntervals start the week on sunday by default. If you wish to specify another weekday on which the tickInterval should start, use the weekday option:
例: 
gantt
  tickInterval 1week
  weekday monday

Comments
Comments can be entered within a gantt chart, which will be ignored by the parser. Comments need to be on their own line and must be prefaced with %% (double percent signs). Any text after the start of the comment to the next newline will be treated as a comment, including any diagram syntax.
例: 
gantt
    title A Gantt Diagram
    %% This is a comment
    dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD
    section Section
        A task          :a1, 2014-01-01, 30d
        Another task    :after a1, 20d
    section Another
        Task in Another :2014-01-12, 12d
        another task    :24d

Today marker
You can style or hide the marker for the current date. To style it, add a value for the todayMarker key.
例: 
todayMarker stroke-width:5px,stroke:#0f0,opacity:0.5

To hide the marker, set todayMarker to off.
例: 
todayMarker off
