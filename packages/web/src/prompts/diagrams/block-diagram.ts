Simple Block Diagrams
Basic Structure
At its core, a block diagram consists of blocks representing different entities or components. In Mermaid, these blocks are easily created using simple text labels. The most basic form of a block diagram can be a series of blocks without any connectors.
例: 
block-beta
  a b c

Defining the number of columns to use
Column Usage
While simple block diagrams are linear and straightforward, more complex systems may require a structured layout. Mermaid allows for the organization of blocks into multiple columns, facilitating the creation of more intricate and detailed diagrams.
例: 
block-beta
  columns 3
  a b c d

Advanced Block Configuration
Building upon the basics, this section delves into more advanced features of block diagramming in Mermaid. These features allow for greater flexibility and complexity in diagram design, accommodating a wider range of use cases and scenarios.

Setting Block Width
Spanning Multiple Columns
In more complex diagrams, you may need blocks that span multiple columns to emphasize certain components or to represent larger entities. Mermaid allows for the adjustment of block widths to cover multiple columns, enhancing the diagram's readability and structure.
例: 
block-beta
  columns 3
  a["A label"] b:2 c:2 d

Creating Composite Blocks
Nested Blocks
Composite blocks, or blocks within blocks, are an advanced feature in Mermaid's block diagram syntax. They allow for the representation of nested or hierarchical systems, where one component encompasses several subcomponents.
例: 
block-beta
  block
    D
  end
  A["A: I am a wide one"]

Column Width Dynamics
Adjusting Widths
Mermaid also allows for dynamic adjustment of column widths based on the content of the blocks. The width of the columns is determined by the widest block in the column, ensuring that the diagram remains balanced and readable.
例: 
block-beta
  columns 3
  a:3
  block:group1:2
    columns 2
    h i j k
  end
  g
  block:group2:3
    %% columns auto (default)
    l m n o p q r
  end

Merging Blocks Horizontally: In scenarios where you need to stack blocks horizontally, you can use column width to accomplish the task. Blocks can be arranged vertically by putting them in a single column. Here is how you can create a block diagram in which 4 blocks are stacked on top of each other:
block-beta
  block
    columns 1
    a["A label"] b c d
  end

Block Varieties and Shapes
Mermaid's block diagrams are not limited to standard rectangular shapes. A variety of block shapes are available, allowing for a more nuanced and tailored representation of different types of information or entities. This section outlines the different block shapes you can use in Mermaid and their specific applications.

Standard and Special Block Shapes
Mermaid supports a range of block shapes to suit different diagramming needs, from basic geometric shapes to more specialized forms.
例: 
block-beta
  id1("This is the text in the box")

Stadium-Shaped Block
A stadium-shaped block, resembling an elongated circle, can be used for components that are process-oriented:
例: 
block-beta
  id1(["This is the text in the box"])

Subroutine Shape
For representing subroutines or contained processes, a block with double vertical lines is useful:
block-beta
  id1[["This is the text in the box"]]

Cylindrical Shape
The cylindrical shape is ideal for representing databases or storage components:
block-beta
  id1[("Database")]

Circle Shape
A circle can be used for centralized or pivotal components:
block-beta
  id1(("This is the text in the circle"))

Asymmetric, Rhombus, and Hexagon Shapes
For decision points, use a rhombus, and for unique or specialized processes, asymmetric and hexagon shapes can be utilized:
Asymmetric
block-beta
  id1>"This is the text in the box"]

Rhombus
block-beta
  id1{"This is the text in the box"}

Hexagon
block-beta
  id1{{"This is the text in the box"}}

Parallelogram and Trapezoid Shapes
Parallelogram and trapezoid shapes are perfect for inputs/outputs and transitional processes:
block-beta
  id1[/"This is the text in the box"/]
  id2[\\"This is the text in the box"\\]
  A[/"Christmas"\\]
  B[\\"Go shopping"/]

Double Circle
For highlighting critical or high-priority components, a double circle can be effective:
block-beta
  id1((("This is the text in the circle")))

Block Arrows and Space Blocks
Mermaid also offers unique shapes like block arrows and space blocks for directional flow and spacing.
Block Arrows
Block arrows can visually indicate direction or flow within a process:
block-beta
  blockArrowId<["Label"]>(right)
  blockArrowId2<["Label"]>(left)
  blockArrowId3<["Label"]>(up)
  blockArrowId4<["Label"]>(down)
  blockArrowId5<["Label"]>(x)
  blockArrowId6<["Label"]>(y)
  blockArrowId6<["Label"]>(x, down)

Space Blocks
Space blocks can be used to create intentional empty spaces in the diagram, which is useful for layout and readability:
block-beta
  columns 3
  a space b
  c   d   e

or
block-beta
  ida space:3 idb idc

Connecting Blocks with Edges
One of the key features of block diagrams in Mermaid is the ability to connect blocks using various types of edges or links. This section explores the different ways blocks can be interconnected to represent relationships and flows between components.

Basic Linking and Arrow Types
The most fundamental aspect of connecting blocks is the use of arrows or links. These connectors depict the relationships or the flow of information between the blocks. Mermaid offers a range of arrow types to suit different diagramming needs.
Basic Links
A simple link with an arrow can be created to show direction or flow from one block to another:
block-beta
  A space B
  A-->B

Text on Links
In addition to connecting blocks, it's often necessary to describe or label the relationship. Mermaid allows for the inclusion of text on links, providing context to the connections.
block-beta
  A space:2 B
  A-- "X" -->B

Edges and Styles:
block-beta
columns 1
  db(("DB"))
  blockArrowId6<["&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"]>(down)
  block:ID
    A
    B["A wide one in the middle"]
    C
  end
  space
  D
  ID --> D
  C --> D
  style B fill:#939,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px

Styling and Customization
Individual Block Styling
Mermaid enables detailed styling of individual blocks, allowing you to apply various CSS properties such as color, stroke, and border thickness. This feature is especially useful for highlighting specific parts of a diagram or for adhering to certain visual themes.
Styling a Single Block
To apply custom styles to a block, you can use the style keyword followed by the block identifier and the desired CSS properties:
block-beta
  id1 space id2
  id1("Start")-->id2("Stop")
  style id1 fill:#636,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
  style id2 fill:#bbf,stroke:#f66,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff,stroke-dasharray: 5 5

Practical Examples and Use Cases
etailed Examples Illustrating Various Features
Combining the elements of structure, linking, and styling, we can create comprehensive diagrams that serve specific purposes in different contexts.

Example - System Architecture
Illustrating a simple software system architecture with interconnected components:
block-beta
  columns 3
  Frontend blockArrowId6<[" "]>(right) Backend
  space:2 down<[" "]>(down)
  Disk left<[" "]>(left) Database[("Database")]

  classDef front fill:#696,stroke:#333;
  classDef back fill:#969,stroke:#333;
  class Frontend front
  class Backend,Database back

Business Process Flow
Representing a business process flow with decision points and multiple stages:
block-beta
  columns 3
  Start(("Start")) space:2
  down<[" "]>(down) space:2
  Decision{{"Make Decision"}} right<["Yes"]>(right) Process1["Process A"]
  downAgain<["No"]>(down) space r3<["Done"]>(down)
  Process2["Process B"] r2<["Done"]>(right) End(("End"))

  style Start fill:#969;
  style End fill:#696;

Common Syntax Errors
Understanding and avoiding common syntax errors is key to a smooth experience with Mermaid diagrams.
Example - Incorrect Linking
A common mistake is incorrect linking syntax, which can lead to unexpected results or broken diagrams:
block-beta
  A - B
Correction: Ensure that links between blocks are correctly specified with arrows (--> or ---) to define the direction and type of connection. Also remember that one of the fundaments for block diagram is to give the author full control of where the boxes are positioned so in the example you need to add a space between the boxes:
block-beta
  A space B
  A --> B

Misplaced Styling
Applying styles in the wrong context or with incorrect syntax can lead to blocks not being styled as intended:
  block-beta
    A
    style A fill#969;
Correction: Correct the syntax by ensuring proper separation of style properties with commas and using the correct CSS property format:
block-beta
  A
  style A fill:#969,stroke:#333;

Tips for Complex Diagram Structures
Managing complexity in Mermaid diagrams involves planning and employing best practices.

Modular Design
Break down complex diagrams into smaller, more manageable components. This approach not only makes the diagram easier to understand but also simplifies the creation and maintenance process.
Consistent Styling
Use classes to maintain consistent styling across similar elements. This not only saves time but also ensures a cohesive and professional appearance.
Comments and Documentation
Use comments with %% within the Mermaid syntax to document the purpose of various parts of the diagram. This practice is invaluable for maintaining clarity, especially when working in teams or returning to a diagram after some time.
